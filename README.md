# Tableau Web Data Connector SDK
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tableau/webdataconnector/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://coveralls.io/github/tableau/webdataconnector?branch=dev) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tableau/webdataconnector.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/tableau/webdataconnector)

Currently in development is version 2.1 of the web data connector API.

Listed below are features that we are working on for the 2.1 release of the API.  Please note, none of these features are guranteed to ship with a particular version of the Tableau product, or necessarily ship at all.  But we are very interested in gathering early feedback from the community! So please try these out and let us know what you think.

##2.1 Beta Features
###Standard Connections
Adding standard connections to the Web Data Connector API. Standard Connections lets WDC authors create predefined joins that users are able to pull out in Tableau just like a table. The simulator has a visualization and verification feature added that will help developers create and test their standard connections. Use the *Advanced* button on the top right to reveal the standard connections module.

We don't have documentation (yet!) for this feature, but please see the StandardConnectionsExample.html example for guidance on how to use the new API.
