To help you create web data connectors, you can use Web Data Connector
SDK. The SDK includes the following:

-   The web data connector simulator, which lets you test and debug web
    data connectors. For more information, see [Web Data Connector
    Simulator](wdc_simulator.html).

-   Sample web data connectors that illustrate how to implement a web
    data connector and explore the web data connector's various features
    such as authentication, chunking (paging), and incremental refresh.
    For more information, see [Web Data Connector SDK
    Samples](wdc_sdk_samples.html).

-   Batch files that start a Python web server. You can use the Python
    web server when you test web data connectors in the simulator, and
    to load your web data connector in Tableau.

To install the web data connector SDK
-------------------------------------

1.  In your browser, go to the [Tableau
    webdataconnector](https://github.com/tableau/webdataconnector) page
    on GitHub.

2.  Clone the repo, or download the SDK as a .zip file and extract the
    contents into a folder on your computer.

Contributing to the Web Data Connector project
----------------------------------------------

You can contribute to the official Web Data Connector project on GitHub.
For example, you can help improve the WDC simulator, or you can help
improve samples that show how to use web data connectors .

For information about how you can contribute, see the [Tableau Open
Source Projects](https://tableau.github.io/) page on GitHub.
